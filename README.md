## Task

A marketing agency contacted me in order to increase the accessibility of their webstie. Along with this I was tasked with taking the existing code and refactoring it (improving/changing the code without changing what it does).

## Outcome

Many things in the css file were combined creating cleaner and less busy code. Along with this a few items were added to the HTML file to make it more semantic.
